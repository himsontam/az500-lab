**Evidence Reporting Document**

- **Introduction**

_The main goal of this document is to keep track of the practical hands-on work experience and lab challenges you will complete throughout the program. By doing so, at the end of the program, you will have a great portfolio that you can use for evidence of your practical skills, and you can also come back for review whenever needed. This evidence is essential in the long run and keeps you on track with the time you will spend on your career upgrade process. These notes will also play a vital role in identifying the skills and tools to reflect on your marketing materials like your CV/resume or LinkedIn Page._

In this lab I have working following exercise:

- Create an Azure web app
  - I use an Azure [App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview) web app to host your website in the cloud in a fully managed environment. An [App Service plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans) defines the capacity and scalability of the web servers that support your website.
  - Enable **Application Insights**
  - Apply monitoring settings
- Deploy sample application code
  - Apply **External Git** code in azure **Deployment Center** for deploying ASP.NET Application
- Enable authentication by using Microsoft Entra ID
  - Configure Microsoft Entra ID for the web app by using **Microsoft** as the identity provider
  - I can configure [Azure App Service authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-aad?tabs=workforce-tenant) to define your application authentication requirements by using Microsoft Entra ID as your authentication provider.
