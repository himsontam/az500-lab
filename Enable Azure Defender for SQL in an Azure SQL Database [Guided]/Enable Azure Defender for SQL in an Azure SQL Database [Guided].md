**Evidence Reporting Document**

- **Introduction**

_The main goal of this document is to keep track of the practical hands-on work experience and lab challenges you will complete throughout the program. By doing so, at the end of the program, you will have a great portfolio that you can use for evidence of your practical skills, and you can also come back for review whenever needed. This evidence is essential in the long run and keeps you on track with the time you will spend on your career upgrade process. These notes will also play a vital role in identifying the skills and tools to reflect on your marketing materials like your CV/resume or LinkedIn Page._
