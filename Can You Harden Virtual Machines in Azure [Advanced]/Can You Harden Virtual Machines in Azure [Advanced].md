**Practical Work Experience and Portfolio Building**

**Evidence Reporting Document**

- **Introduction**

_The main goal of this document is to keep track of the practical hands-on work experience and lab challenges you will complete throughout the program. By doing so, at the end of the program, you will have a great portfolio that you can use for evidence of your practical skills, and you can also come back for review whenever needed. This evidence is essential in the long run and keeps you on track with the time you will spend on your career upgrade process. These notes will also play a vital role in identifying the skills and tools to reflect on your marketing materials like your CV/resume or LinkedIn Page._

**Name of the Challenge:** Can You Harden Virtual Machines in Azure \[Advanced\]

**Access Details (URL or source):** AZ500

**Details of the Challenge:**

In this lab I have working following exercise:

Create an Azure virtual network by using a network security group

Create a virtual network in the Azure portal

Create a network security group named webNSG in the **corp-datalod41228009** resource group

Associate the webNSG network security group to the **web** subnet in the **webVNET** virtual network.

# Deploy an Azure virtual machine for a web app by using an application security group

- Create an application security group named webASG in the **corp-datalod41228009** resource group.
- Create an Azure virtual machine
- Associate the VM1 virtual machine network interface to the **webASG** application security group.

# Enable web connectivity by using an application security group

Add an inbound security rule

Connect to VM1 through **RDP**

- Install **IIS** on **VM1** by using **Windows PowerShell**Â®.

# Enable Azure Disk Encryption

Create an Azure key vault

Launch an Azure **Cloud Shell** **PowerShell**

Enable Azure Disk Encryption on VM1 in the corp-datalod41228009 resource group by using the Set-AzVMDiskEncryptionExtension PowerShell cmdlet and a vault name of KV41228009

Verify that the encryption succeeded by using the Get-AzVmDiskEncryptionStatus cmdlet.
